# diverse-tv
 
For this project, I analyzed my most-watched TV shows. I wanted to see how diverse they actually are.
The results showed that a lot of the stuff that I watch is made by white men (surprising, right?)
But, it was at least nice to see that some of the shows were a bit diverse when it comes to the main characters & cast. Women
are mostly represented, followed by BIPOCs, and lastly, Queer and Trans folks.

This project helped change my tv consumption habits and made me question who the shows are made by, and how diverse is the cast. I hope that this piece helps influence people to think twice about their watching consumption, and support inclusivity.

I coded the TV using P5.js to show how the entertainment industry is lacking inclusivity, I displayed that through two graphs.
Then, I included a little extra button for another screen to display some of the most diverse shows that made it to my list
(as a recommendation for people to watch), followed by a question, hoping that people will start thinking. 
Are they supporting the ‘currently’ underrepresented communities? I say ‘currently’ because I believe that this lack of
representation will soon change if we continue to talk about it and work on making a change.
